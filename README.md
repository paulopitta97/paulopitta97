# Paulo Pitta

- 👋 Hi, I’m @paulopitta97, Web Developer graduated in Technician in Informatics and Bachelor in Information Systems, both from CEFET/RJ - Nova Friburgo. I am participatory, motivated, responsible and organized, always committed to work and looking for new knowledge. I charge myself a lot and I'm always wanting to evolve, professionally and personally. I started studying programming in 2012, at the age of 15. I've been working with web programming for over 5 years (mainly with PHP on the backend). I'm looking for new knowledge.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new technologies that are on the rise in the job market.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NodeJS (TypeScript), React, React Native and especially about microservices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with the community to share experiences and also acquire new knowledge.
